#### Twitter Space Dynamic URL to Playlist URL

This converts `dynamic_playlist` URL to "`playlist url`" so that you can listen Twitter Space even if it's not recorded.

1. Paste dynamic_playlist [^1] URL as in below:

`https://prod-fastly-eu-central-1.video.pscp.tv/Transcoding/v1/hls/*****/non_transcode/eu-central-1/periscope-replay-direct-prod-eu-central-1-public/audio-space/dynamic_playlist.m3u8?type=live`

2. Get playable [^2] playlist url as in below:

`https://prod-fastly-eu-central-1.video.pscp.tv/Transcoding/v1/hls/*****/non_transcode/eu-central-1/periscope-replay-direct-prod-eu-central-1-public/audio-space/playlist_*****.m3u8?type=replay`

[^1]: You have to get this URL while Twitter Space is live. You can use IDM or some browser extension like [The Stream Detector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hls-stream-detector/) that catches media.
[^2]: You can paste this url to media players like VLC, MPV and listen or you can dowload it with a download manager.
